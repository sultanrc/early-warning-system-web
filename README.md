# early-warning-system-web
Consist of Arduino, PHP for Dashboard and Report, Google App Script, and Node-Red Service. 

The Early Warning System (EWS) is a monitoring system designed to operate the DHT11 sensor to detect temperature and humidity levels. This system will send an email notification if the temperature in the server room exceeds 30°C and if the humidity is higher than 80%. Additionally, the temperature and humidity data will be stored in a database and displayed on a website for real-time monitoring.

Features
Temperature & Humidity Monitoring: Measures temperature and humidity using the DHT11 sensor.
Email Alerts: Sends notifications when temperature > 30°C or humidity > 80%.
Database Integration: Stores data for historical tracking.
Web Interface: Displays real-time data for monitoring.
